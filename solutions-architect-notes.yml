IAM access keys: long term credentials, used with IAM users only,
use access keys when using CLI,
dont change automatically or regularly,
similar to user name and password, but differences are:
an IAM user can have two access keys, either 0, 1, or 2,
can be created, deleted, made inactive or active,
formed from two parts: access key ID, and secret access key
access key id is like username, while secret acces key is like password

aws configure: allows us to configure the default configuration for CLI
aws configure --profile namedProfile: named profiles, allow us to configure multiple aws accounts to our CLI instead of just using one account, whenever running commands append '--profile nameOfProfile' to run from NameOfProfile account


NIST definition of cloud computing: 5 characteristics of cloud computing 
On demand self service: allows you to provision capabilities as needed without requiring human interaction
broad network access: capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms
Resource pooling: about abstraction, there is a sens of location independence and resources are pooled to server multiple consumers using a multi tenant model
Rapid elasticity: resources can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly in real time with no human interaction
Measured service: Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, reported, and billed 


Public vs Private vs Hybrid vs Multi Cloud Models:
multi-cloud: using multiple public clouds for higher levels of availability and durability
private: aws outposts, is on premise and still meets 5 requirements of cloud computing, most on premise traditional datacenters do not meet 5 requirements
hybrid: using both public cloud and private cloud cooperating together as a single environment

hybrid environment: using public cloud on your on premise infrastructure


YAML: language for defining data or configuration
characteristics:
unordered collection of key-value pairs, (dictionary)
indentation matters, spaces are like brackets



Encryption:
  

Encryption at rest: helps to secure data from physical access, example would be encrypting data stored on a hard drive, and decrypting when it reads.  Secret(password) is used to decrypt the data.
In cloud computing, data is encrypted while in s3
encryption at transit: helps to secure data that is being transferred between two place, encrypted with an encryption tunnel

Plaintext: un-encrypted data, data that you can load into an app and use
algorithm: code that takes plain text and an encryption key and generates encrypted data
ciphertext: encrypted data

key: "password", decrypts ciphertext
  different types: symmetric key
    symmetric key: same key is used for both encryption and decryption processes, used by a single party
    asymmetric key: comprised of public and private keys, public key is used to encrypt, the private key is used to decrypt, used by two or more parties

signing: allows verification of who sent the encrypted message,
        requires the sender to sign with private key,
        requires the receiver to decrypt signature with sender's public key

steganography: allows you to embed data inside other data, like hiding ciphertext in an image



NETWORKING:


OSI 5 LAYER MODEL: networking stack, that includes seven software layers for transporting data
  physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, application layers
  layer x understands its layer and below, built on top of other layers

  media layers: how data is moved between point A and B
  physical, data link, network, 
  
  host layers: how data is chopped up and reassembled for transport and formatted to be understood by both sides of a network connection,
  transport, session, presentation, application layers

Physical Layer: Layer 1: defines the transmission and reception of raw bit streams between a device and a shared physical medium.

can be different physical mediums, copper(electrical), fibre(light), or WIFI(RF)
no device addressing at layer 1, all data is processed by all devices
if multiple devices transmit at once a collission occurs
no media access control and no collision detection
tend to not scale very well

  hub: anything received on any port, is transmitted on every other port, including errors and collisions


Data Link Layer: Layer, 2: packages frame to be sent on layer 1, the physical layer
  ethernet: most popular l2 protocol used generally for local networks 

  MAC address: unique hardware address

  frames: format for sending information over layer 2 network, can be addressed to MAC address or broadcast to all
    payload: the data the frame carries from source to destination.  It's generally provided by layer 3 and the ET attribute defines which l3 protocol is used

  CSMA/CD: provides controlled access to physical medium via:
  carrier sense multiple access: checks carrier(to see if anything is transmitting on layer 1), and if no carrier then passes frame to layer 1 to transmit, if there is carrier it waits to send until a carrier is not detected
  collision detection: detects if there was collision, if there was collision reattempts collision after a certain amount of time

  switch: intelligent layer 2 device that works similarly to a hub but much more efficient because it understands layer 2 
  HOW IT WORKS:
  learns which devices are connected at layer 2 and populates a MAC address table with that MAC address's port
  if it receives frame for MAC address in table, it orders that frame to be sent to that port only on layer 1, unlike a hub which would send to every single port
  if it receives frame for MAC address not in table, it sends to all ports
  every x port has X collision domains, meaning if there is a collision on a port, it only occurs on that single port

Network Layer, Layer 3: gets data from one location to another
uses packets which are similar to frames,
generally an ip packet doesnt change, while a frame does between each lvl2 destination because a frame has address of next intermediary address and ip packet has source ip address and destination ip address,

contains l4 protocol in packet in protocol field and data received from layer 4 

ipv4 and ipv6 packets, ipv6 packets have larger addresses

ipv4 addressing:
DHCP: machine that assigns IP addresses
Ip addresses have a network part and a host part, if they have same network part they are on same network
subnet masks: divides the host and network part via shorthand prefix(starts from left), letting an IP device know if another device is on same network or not, which influences if it communicates directly with device or default gateway

Every router has one or more route tables, letting router know where to send packet or destination.  Packets are routed, hop by hop across the internet.  

default gateway: IP address on local network that packets are forwarded to if intended desination is not a local ip address 

ARP, Address Resolution Protocol: finds Mac address for a given IP address,
a protocol that allows us to encapsulate layer 3 packet in a l2 frame, broadcasts to all devices on the ip address network and asks for mac adress, the corresponding device then sends mac address and frame is created
ipv6: 



How to convert decimal to binary for IPv4 addressing: 
133.33.33.7 <=> 10000101.00100001.00100001.00000111
Each number in dotted decimal notation maps to 8 bits
